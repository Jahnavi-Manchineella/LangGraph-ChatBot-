🌐 LangGraph Chatbot
This repository demonstrates how to build a chatbot using the LangGraph framework. 🚀 The example focuses on leveraging state management to handle chatbot interactions efficiently.

✨ Features
⚙️ State Management: Uses StateGraph to define and manage chatbot states.

📨 Message Handling: Implements a function to append messages to the chatbot's state dynamically.

📈 Scalability: Designed to scale and adapt to complex chatbot requirements.

📦 Installation
To run this project, you'll need the following:

🐍 Python 3.8 or higher

📓 Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

🛠️ Required Libraries

📖 Notebook Overview
🛠️ Part 1: Setup
📥 Import necessary modules:

StateGraph for managing states

add_messages for updating the state dynamically

📋 Part 2: Define State and Chatbot
🛡️ The State class uses TypedDict to define the structure of the chatbot's state.

🤖 The chatbot function processes the state and generates responses.

🧩 Example Code Snippets
🖋️ Defining the State


class State(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]

graph_builder = StateGraph(State)
🤖 Chatbot Function

def chatbot(state: State):
    return {"messages": llm.invoke(state['messages'])}
